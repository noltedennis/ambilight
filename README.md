## ambilight
This project is a minimalistic Ambilight implementation written in Go. It aims to provide baseline functionality to offer good Ambilight results. It ís specifically designed to run with the Raspberry Pi, LED stripes and a USB Video Grabber.

## Motivation
Already existing toolsuites often offer a rich featureset and are ideal if the Raspberry Pi is dedicated to just provide the Ambilight functionality. This project was built in scenarios where the Raspberry Pi is not dedicated for the Ambilight, but instead also fulfills other home server functionalities. Therefore, it aims to minimize necessary performance. It also aims to reduce configuration to the minimum to be able to set it up as quickly as possible.
